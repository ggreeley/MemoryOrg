A Minimal R Package Dedicated to Quantifying Retrieval Organization (A Few Ways)

## What the Package Does and Why

Computes Adjusted Ratio of Clustering (ARC), Paired Frequency (PF), and the Shared Organization Metric Analysis (SOMA)

**ARC** (Roenker et al. 1971)...(More on the measure, what it dos, and why it is important)

**PF** (Sternberg & Tulving, 1977)...(More on the measure, what it dos, and why it is important)

**SOMA** (Congleton & Rajaram, 2014)...(More on the measure, what it dos, and why it is important)
